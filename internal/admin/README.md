# Admin Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the Admin interface:

- CSS styles
- JavaScript files
- Images and icons

The Qor Admin framework will automatically load its own assets, but you can add custom assets here to extend the admin UI.

## Directory Structure

```
public/admin/
├── css/         # Custom CSS styles
├── js/          # Custom JavaScript files
├── images/      # Custom images and icons
└── README.md    # This file
```

## Usage

To add custom assets to the admin interface, you can add them to the appropriate subdirectory and then load them in your admin templates.
